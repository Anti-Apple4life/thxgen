# tymaker
Generates Thank-You notes from information
This is a very basic c# program that I made in 3 hours at school. It can be used for writing thank-you notes, although it it is not finished.
You can grab the latest build from [![Tymaker Builds](https://github.com/Anti-Apple4life/tymaker-group/actions/workflows/tymaker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Anti-Apple4life/tymaker-group/actions/workflows/tymaker.yml). A stable release will be posted soon.
